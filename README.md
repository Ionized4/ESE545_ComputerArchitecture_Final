# ESE545_ComputerArchitecture_Final

This repository contains the VHDL source and related documents for my submission for the final project of ESE545 - Computer Architecture at Stony Brook in 2022.
The project requirements were to generate a cycle-accurate HDL model of the Cell SPU given a subset of instructions detailed in the ISA.
